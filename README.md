## 🛠️ Compiling

### 🐧 Unix-like
After installing SDL2, SDL2_TTF and SDL2_Image, execute the following commands
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kotivas/Cnake
cd cnake
mkdir obj bin
make


```
The compiled executable file will be located in ``./bin/``

Be sure to run with `./bin/cnake` **out of the root directory** of the repository. 
Otherwise the game will not be able to find assets.
